### Basic AWS VPC with one public subnet and two private subnets


This example depicts a creation of a basic AWS VPC
Resources created:
* VPC 
* Subnets
* Routes 
* Route tables 
* Elastic IP (EIP)
* NAT Gateway 
* Route table association


#### Basic VPC 
AWS VPC stands for Virtual Private Cloud which basically provides a way to structure your own network the way you want in AWS. 
Before we dive in let's define some basic VPC basic concepts:

* CIDR - Classless Intern-Domain Routing 
Let's choose the address ranges which will be `172.31.0.0/16` in binary will give us `1010 1100.1111 0000.0000 0000.0000 0000`
